# SalesDataAnalysis

# Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a sales dataset to extract insights, identify trends, and visualize key patterns. The goal is to better understand sales performance, customer behavior, and regional distribution.

# Dataset Information
The dataset contains sales records with the following key attributes:
- Order Details: Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode
- Customer Information: Customer ID, Customer Name, Segment
- Geographic Data: Country, City, State, Region
- Product Details: Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name
- Sales & Financials: Sales Amount, Profit, Quantity, Discount

# Tools & Libraries Used
- Pandas – Data manipulation & cleaning
- NumPy – Numerical computations
- Matplotlib – Data visualization
- Seaborn – Statistical data visualization

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Steps
1. Data Cleaning – Handling missing values, fixing data types, and removing inconsistencies.
2. Statistical Summary – Understanding key metrics like average sales, profit, and order volume.
3. Data Visualization – Generating insightful plots to uncover trends.
   - Sales trends over time
   - Most profitable product categories
   - Sales distribution by region
   - Customer purchasing behavior
4. Correlation Analysis – Understanding relationships between sales parameters.

# Key Insights
- Sales Trends: Identified peak and low sales periods.
- Top Performing Categories: Determined the most profitable and highest-selling product categories.
- Regional Performance: Analyzed sales distribution across different regions.
- Customer Behavior: Explored purchase patterns based on segments.

# How to Run the Project
1. Have pandas, seaborn and matplotlib libraries installed
2. Run ' python sales_data_analysis.py '

# Future Improvements
- Advanced data preprocessing for deeper insights
- Machine learning model to predict sales trends
- Dashboard development for interactive visualization
